## Index (html and css)
I decided to make my page about an Argentinian Musician, Charly Garc√≠a, so I divided my page in 3 decades (70, 80 and 90).
Index page was the worst part, because I knew what I wanted to do but I didn't know how to do it. I searched a lot and I ended up doing the 3 divs with images, hovers, and clickables.

##1970
I wanted to do each decade page more complex than the previous one
