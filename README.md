## Index (html and css)
I decided to make my page about an Argentinian Musician, Charly Garc√≠a, so I divided my page in 3 decades (70, 80 and 90).
Index page was the worst part, because I knew what I wanted to do but I did not know how to do it. I searched a lot and I ended up doing the 3 divs with images, hovers, and clickables.

## 1970
I wanted to do each decade page more complex than the previous one. Thats because "1970" is the simplest. I made it with my old and basic knowledge of css and html. It has a list and a table (besides the nav bar). In the css it has media queries, in order to make the header responsive.

## 1980
In this part of the web page, I started using bootstrap (even though it wasnt easy), so I divided everything usin grid. Furthermore, the table was made with boostrap and I added some images.

## 1990
The final html (and css) page is the more complete. It has boostrap grid and tables, images, lists and a button (I used the disabled state in order to show in which page are you). Also, I used sass for this one. So it has sass nesting, inheritance and variables (at the top of the scss page).

I wanted you to know that I am not an english native,that is why my content is in spanish (but if you want I can translate it). Also, this one is my first "big" project. And I had never used sass, boostrap and git before, it was a great experience.
